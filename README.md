# Andrew's Utils

My own utils for my own use. I created this package so I didn't have to type the same code over and over and to learn how to do deployments and basic version control. I'm trying to keep it dependencyless, but that may change.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @andrewdragon/utils
```

```bash
pnpm i @andrewdragon/utils
```

## Usage

```ts
import { randomNumber } from "@andrewdragon/utils"
```

## Contributing

This package isn't really for public use, but if you want to use it and see any improvements I could add go ahead and make a PR or create an Issue
